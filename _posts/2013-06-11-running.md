The [couch to 5k](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) running
plan from cool running is one of the most effective running plans that I know
today. Last fall, I managed to complete the entire program and run 5k's all the
way to harvard (only to eat at chutney's at the end of it). However, completing
the masters program and thesis worries kept me from running in spring, and I 
lost all the stamina that I gained over the last year. 

The end of my master's degree seems like a nice time to re-evaluate my life
choices till now, and formulate a plan for the future.

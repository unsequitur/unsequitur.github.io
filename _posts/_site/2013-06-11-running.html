<p>The <a href='http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml'>couch to 5k</a> running plan from cool running is one of the most effective running plans that I know today. Last fall, I managed to complete the entire program and run 5k&#8217;s all the way to harvard (only to eat at chutney&#8217;s at the end of it). However, completing the masters program and thesis worries kept me from running in spring, and I lost all the stamina that I gained over the last year.</p>

<p>The end of my master&#8217;s degree seems like a nice time to re-evaluate my life choices till now, and formulate a plan for the future.</p>

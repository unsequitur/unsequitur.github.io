When economists talk about interest rates in the economy, they refer to the 
interest rates on a broad class of government-issued securities ranging from 
the one month T-bill to the ten year Treasury note. Since these interest
rates often move together, it is convenient to talk about the trends associated
with interest rates in general.

When we talk about interest rates, we must make a distinction between two types
of interest rates: real and nominal rates. The nominal interest rate $$R$$ 
refers to the interest that is promised on the face of the bond/bill. For 
example, if you purchase a bond that promises to pay 5% of its face value as 
interest each year, the the nominal interest rate in this case is 5%.

On the other hand, the real interest rate accounts for the loss in purchasing 
power of the currency due to inflation. If the same bond as before is issued 
in a country with 2% annual inflation (say, $$i$$), then the nominal interest 
rate $$r$$ can be approximately computed as $$r \approx R-i =$$3%. The exact
relationship between the real and nominal interest rates is given as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rnom}
r = \frac{1+R}{1+i}
\end{equation}

Equation ($$\ref{eq:rnom}$$) becomes exact when all the rates are continuously
compounded.

This study session provides the econmics tols for understanding how product and 
resource markets function, and the competitive character of different 
industries. 
While macroeconomics deals with aggreate economic quantities, microecnomics 
deals with the markets and decision making of individual econmic units, including
consumers and businesses.

Demand and Supply analysis
--------------------------

Demand and supply analysis is the study of how buyers and sellers interact to 
determine transaction prices and quantities. This is the most basic set of
microecnomic tools. They help the analyst understand how a shoft in the market
will affect a firm's revenues, earnings and cash flows.

###Types of markets
It is important to understand the markets that firms buy and sell in.

####Factor markets
Markets for factors of production (Households own the factors of production
like land, labour capital). In this market, the firms are the buyers and the
households are the sellers.

####Goods markets
Markets for the output of production. In these markets, the firms are the 
sellers and the households (buying final goods) and firms (buying intermediate
goods) are the buyers.

In other words,

(Individuals) --Factor markets--> (Firms) --Goods markets--> (Individuals, Firms)

Market interactions (trades) take place when 
1. The price of a good exceeds the cost of making it (for the firm)
2. The perceived value of the good exceeds the payment necessary to acquire it
(for the consumer)

In such an exchange, both parties are better off.

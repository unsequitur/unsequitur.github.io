The art of time-series modeling is to identify the joint distribution of a set
of random variables $$X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$$ from a single realization of
those random variables $$x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n$$. While this problem might seem
vastly underconstrained, assumptions of normality and stationarity greatly
simplify and regularize this problem.

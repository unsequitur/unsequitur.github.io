Intuitively, a stationary process is one that does not evolve in time. In
other words, the underlying stochastic model is assumed to be the same. At the
outset, this might seem like a reasonable modeling requirement: It is very 
difficult to model a process whose underlying characteristics evolve through
time, with just a single realization of the process.

Mathematically, stationarity can be defined in two ways. Strong stationarity
requires that
